                            Godavari river has been an integral part of the life of Nashik since the time the city was
                            founded
                            along the river banks. People who can afford, migrate to a well-developed area to avail
                            themselves the
                            luxurious facilities like clean roads, landscaped gardens, open space for a playground for their
                            children,
                            jogging tracks, spacious parking, security in the society, etc. all these facilities are not
                            present in the
                            core of the city at this moment. And Riverfront Development is the perfect solution for this
                            issue.</p>
                        <p>
                            Godavari riverfront development can be an environmental, social upliftment & urban rejuvenation
                            which will
                            renew Nashik. The project aims to reclaim the unused asset of the river bank and restore the
                            city. It will
                            give a completely new look to the riverfront available. Cleanliness will create attraction for
                            the citizens.
                            It will increase the pride of Nashik as well as the Godavari River.
