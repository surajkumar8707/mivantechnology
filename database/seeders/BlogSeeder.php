But by combining <strong>Mivan Technology</strong> with <strong>Post-Tensioning</strong>, you get both — and much more.</p><h3>🏗️ What is Post-Tensioning?</h3><p>Post-tensioning is a structural system that strengthens concrete <strong>after it has been poured</strong>, using tensioned steel tendons. When paired with Mivan’s seamless formwork system, it creates <strong>stronger, lighter, and more flexible</strong> structures.</p><h3>🔍 How the Two Work Together</h3><ul><li>Mivan enables <strong>fast, monolithic casting</strong> of concrete walls and floors.</li><li>Post-tensioning improves the <strong>load-bearing capacity</strong> of slabs and beams.</li><li>Together, they create buildings with <strong>fewer columns</strong>, <strong>larger spans</strong>, and <strong>minimal cracking</strong>.</li></ul><h3>💡 Benefits for High-Rise and Commercial Projects</h3><ul><li>🔹 Reduced slab thickness</li><li>🔹 Faster floor cycles (1 floor in 5–7 days)</li><li>🔹 Open floor layouts (ideal for offices, showrooms, etc.)</li><li>🔹 Lower maintenance costs</li><li>🔹 Earthquake and vibration resistance</li></ul><h3>🧠 Smart Building, Smart Investment</h3><p>Whether you're constructing a <strong>residential tower</strong>, a <strong>commercial complex</strong>, or an <strong>industrial facility</strong>, this duo delivers unmatched value.
